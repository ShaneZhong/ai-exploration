Final Answer: NVIDIA Corp. (ticker: NVDA) has been in the investor spotlight as the company recently reported a notable increase in its Q3 2024 fiscal year revenue, going up by 206% from the previous year.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
Two customers accounted for 14% and 11% of our accounts receivable balance as of January 29, 2023. Two customers each accounted for 11% of our accounts receivable balance as of January 30, 2022.
The following table summarizes information pertaining to our revenue by each of the specialized markets we serve:Do I need to use a tool? No
Final Answer: NVIDIA's last year's revenue was $26,974 million. This was a slight increase from the previous year's revenue of $26,914 million. The revenue was primarily driven by Compute & Networking which contributed $15,068 million and Graphics which contributed $11,906 million. 

Despite the overall increase in revenue, NVIDIA saw a 27% decrease in Professional Visualization revenue and a 61% decrease in OEM and Other revenue. On the other hand, Automotive revenue was up 60% reflecting growth in sales of self-driving solutions, computing solutions for electric vehicle makers, and strength in sales of AI cockpit solutions.

It is also noticeable that no single customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for the fiscal years of 2023, 2022, and 2021, suggesting a diversified customer base. This can be considered a strength as it reduces the company's dependency on any single customer.

Investment and Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The investment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and strategic growth of our businesses.
As of the end of fiscal year 2023, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 0.5% would result in changes in fair values for these investments of $17 million.

Concentration of Revenue
Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 69% and 84% of total revenue for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decline in revenue outside the U.S. was primarily driven by China and Taiwan related to Data Center and Gaming. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to countries based on the billed location even if the revenue may be attributable to end customers in a different location.
No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal years 2023 and 2022.
